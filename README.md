### Project Assignment
#### "Writing a Shiny Application"

Based on the request of the instructor, the server.R and ui.R scripts for this project assignment are very simple. The scripts use the rnorm function from R to plot a histogram of the normal distribution, also was added the interactive widget sliderInput to permit the user to choose the number of observations, between 10 and 5000, and see the behavior of the histogram.

#### Shiny Application Instructions

Every Shiny app has the same structure: two R scripts saved together in a directory. At a minimum, a Shiny app has ui.R and server.R files.You can create a Shiny app by making a new directory and saving a ui.R and server.R file inside it. Each app will need its own unique directory.You can run a Shiny app by giving the name of its directory to the function runApp. 

Key steps to run the  shiny application:

 1- install.packages("shiny")   
 
 2- library(shiny)   
 
 3- Make an specific directory named for your app.
 
 4- Develop your application in server.R and ui.R.   
 
 4- Save the apps server.R and ui.R script inside that directory.   
 
 5- Launch the app with runApp or RStudioâ€™s keyboard shortcuts.   
 
 6- Exit the Shiny app by clicking escape.
